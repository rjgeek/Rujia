		<h2> An Accountable Decryption System Based
on Privacy-Preserving Smart Contracts (2020) <mark>(new !) <mark></h2>
		<div class="content">
		<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 10px;" src="image/fialka.jpg" width="255" />
	Accountability is a fundamental after-the-fact approach to
detect and punish illegal actions during the execution of a warrant for
accessing users’ sensitive data. To achieve accountability in a security
protocol, a trusted authority is required, denoted as judge, to faithfully
cooperate with the rest of the entities in the system. However, malicious
judges or uncooperative protocol participants may void the accountability mechanism in practice, for example by fabricating fake evidence or
by refusing to provide any evidence at all. To provide remediation to
these issues, in this paper we propose Fialka, a novel accountable decryption system based on privacy-preserving smart contracts (PPSC).
The neutrality that is inherent to a secure blockchain platform is inherited by PPSC which are then used in our approach as an accountable key
manager as well as a transparent judge. To the best of our knowledge,
we present the first PPSC-based accountable decryption system to increase the transparency of warrant execution with formal definitions and
proofs. Furthermore, we provide and evaluate a prototype implementation using the PPSC-enabled platform Oasis Devnet, which additionally
demonstrates the feasibility of Fialka.

		<h2>Auditable Credential Anonymity Revocation based on Blockchain (2019)</h2>

		<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 10px;" src="image/blind.png" width="250" />
	Anonymity revocation is an essential component of credential issuing systems since unconditional anonymity is 
	incompatible with pursuing and sanctioning credential misuse. However, 
	current anonymity revocation approaches have shortcomings with respect to 
	the auditability of the revocation process. In this paper, we propose a novel 
	anonymity revocation approach based on privacy-preserving blockchain-based smart 
	contracts, where the code self-execution property ensures availability and public 
	ledger immutability provides auditability. We describe an instantiation of this approach,
	provide an implementation thereof and conduct a series of evaluations in terms of running time,
	gas cost and latency. The results show that our scheme is feasible and efficient.

		<h2>Security Evaluation of Blockchain-based Protocols (suspend) (2018) </h2>
		<div class="content">
		<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 10px;" src="image/securityframe.png" width="250" />
	Our research primarily aims to build a framework to evaluate the security of blockchain-based systems. This
security framework can analyse not only the backbone protocol but also the basic blockchain-based system
as a whole. As shown in Figure, the framework contains two core components: the blockchain backbone
protocol and the blockchain-based protocol. The backbone protocol can be seen as a distributed system
which is mainly focused on reaching the agreements that have a common data view, while the blockchainbased protocol is a program built on this common shared data to obtain security benefits or improved
functionality. The security properties of backbone protocol include Liveness and Persistence. On the other
hand, the security properties of blockchain as a whole system include Non-equivocation, Unforgeability, etc.
The input of the framework is the specific instance such as the blockchain-based credential system, and the
output is the corresponding security evaluation result with proofs. The framework is designed to check the
particular instance(input) whether it exhibits the above security properties.

		<h2> Blockchain authentication of academic credentials (2017)</h2>
		<div class="content">
		<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 10px;" src="image/org.png" width="250" />
	Employers often want to verify an applicant's academic credentials. Currently, 
	this requires manual processes by institutions to trace records and verify degrees. 
	This approach is slow, subject to individual institutions' record-keeping, and exposes graduates to a 
	lack of privacy concerning when and by whom their credentials are being authenticated. Blockchain offers 
	one solution to this problem. As an "append-only whiteboard in the sky", the blockchain ledger is a 
	verifiable source for cryptographically proving the existence of official documents. 
	Employers can be given an access code by a graduate that enables them to authenticate credentials 
	without having to involve the awarding institution. Similarly, the institutions need only add their records to the Blockchain, 
	saving time and resources. While a blockchain system is designed for transparency, this system also adds a component of privacy for graduates, 
	as their former institution need not be made aware that potential employers are making a request to validate their certificates.
	For sensitive applications, and for enhancing privacy in general while also improving functionality, the blockchain 
	approach is an effective solution to the problem of credential authentication.

		<div class="content">

	HDEX is a decentralized exchange that allows traders to 
independently store and operate funds. 
Users of such exchanges can make transactions with cryptocurrency directly between each other, in which a third-party is not needed.
The current decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap only offer liquidity pools for instantly trading assets.
Our project aims to provide traders both instant exchanges and the order book exchanges.

		<div class="content">
		<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 10px;" src="image/pool.jpg" width="250" />
	The project "Staking" originates from the mode of switching from PoW (Proof-of-work) to PoS, 
	in which transaction validation completed by multiple nodes. 
	Nodes obtain corresponding voting rights by staking a number of tokens. 
	The corresponding economic incentive model is to stake token to get inflation returns. 
	The rate of return varies due to different main networks. 
	In the original staking mode, the token staked by the users is frozen and cannot be traded.
	"Staking" aims to conveniently and 
	securely stake their tokens with a click of a button.

		<div class="content">

	Random numbers are an essential building block for a variety of applications such as key generation and sample selection. Our project aims to utilize a group of blockchain miners (enabled FPGA chips) as the seeds to generate the random number. Each blockchain miner submits a commitment associated with the seed and reveals the cryptographic commitment to obtain a random number in an epoch. The security generated numbers rely on the assumption that there is at least one honest miner.

	Blockchain Name Service (BNS) and DNS work in a similar way. The latter allows people to connect any website with a comprehensible text address, 
	while the former replaces the default complicated hash used in blockchain into human readable names to interact with 
	the decentralized network. However, due to the architectural difference behind the centralized and decentralized network,
	BNS does have some other functions that distinct itself from DNS, 
	including enabling users to send cryptocurrencies, interact with smart contacts, and visit dApps. 
	Our main research is that how to build a BNS based on HPB blockchain to achieve better scalability and security.

	High Performance Blockchain’s revolutionary technology, the Blockchain Offload Engine (BOE), 
	brings us one step closer to the widespread adoption of blockchain technology out in the real world. 
	The unique combination of hardware and software allows all developers from all backgrounds, 
	whether they are large multinationals or small start-ups to take part in the HPB ecosystem, 
	as technical and resource-based barriers to entry are lowered. The BOE hardware unit itself works in tandem with software, 
	and the synergy between the two components alleviates existing bottlenecks in traditional systems.

	In this paper we propose a proof-of-authority enhanced algorithm for better security and decentralization.
	In our model, each consensus node will have its own identity, and network participants will be able to delegate their 
	votes to others in case their primary nodes go offline. 
	Thanks to the Governance DApp, the network will have decentralized governance,
	as changes will be administered through on-chain voting, in a transparent and audit-able manner. 
	Also we use hardware pseudo random number generators to solve the issues of block proposing.
